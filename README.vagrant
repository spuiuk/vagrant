Install vagrant and the libvirt plugin

On libvirt, using the virt-manager,
- Create a storage pool named "vagrant-pool" in which you will store your vagrant machine images.
- I also create a new network pool with address 192.168.140.0/24. When creating a vagrant machine, I add a private interface with a static ip from this range.
